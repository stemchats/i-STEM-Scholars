        <p class="center">The annual i-STEM Scholars Summer Research Program, which connects high school students with university labs to
            contribute to a research project for about 10 weeks. Students are also provided with academic and professional
            development resources, as well as personalized mentorship. Our Summer Research Program is application-based,
            with a focus on students who are FGLI, URM, LGBTQ+, and women, and students spend about 3 months with accredited
            research mentors.</p>

        <h2 class="center medium-box-title center">Summer 2021 Student Application</h1>
        <p>The i-STEM Scholars team is excited to announce that the i-STEM Scholars Summer Research Program application (below) is currently accepting applications! The application will close at 11:49PM PST on March 26, 2021.</p>

        <h2 class="center medium-box-title">Summer Research Program - 2020 Cohort</h2>
        <p>For our first-ever Summer Research Program cohort in 2020, the i-STEM Scholars team partnered with the
            <b>Stockton Lab</b> at the <b>Georgia Institute of Technology</b>. The i-STEM Scholars SRP hosted 10
            students, who each conducted research, participated in academic and professional development, and received
            personal mentorship. The research topic was chemical analyses of meteorites for potential signs of life.</p>
